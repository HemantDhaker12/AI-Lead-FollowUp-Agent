Use details from their notes to personalize the message: "{notes}".

Mention that they came from this source: "{source}".

Keep the tone human, simple, and helpful. The email should:
- Build trust quickly
- Show that you understand what they need
- Offer value without sounding salesy
- End with ONE strong CTA inviting them to reply or book a quick call

Do not include a subject line. Only write the email body.
