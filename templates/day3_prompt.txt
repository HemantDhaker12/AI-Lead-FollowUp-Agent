Write a Day 3 follow-up email to {name} from {company} about their interest in "{product}".

Use "{notes}" to make the email personal and relevant.

The email should include:
- Soft social proof (e.g., “many clients like you…”)
- A gentle reminder that you reached out earlier
- Offer two possible time slots for a quick call
- A clear CTA to confirm one of the times or suggest another

Keep the tone respectful and helpful.  
Do not include a subject line. Only write the email body.
