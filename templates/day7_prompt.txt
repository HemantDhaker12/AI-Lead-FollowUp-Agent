Write a friendly and respectful Day 7 follow-up email to {name} regarding their interest in "{product}".

Use "{notes}" subtly to show you remember their needs.

The email should:
- Acknowledge that they may be busy
- Offer one final helpful tip, resource, or insight
- Politely mention that you will close the file if there’s no reply
- Reassure them they can reach out anytime in the future

Tone must be gentle, professional, and never pushy.  
Do not include a subject line. Only write the email body.
